# Create Push A/B Test Endpoints

## Description

As part of a goal last year to test the effectiveness of my team's push marketing campaigns, 
our team needed to build a process to A/B test how different Target push messages drove guest 
engagement online. 

To create this new Push A/B test process, this epic required Target Marketing Planners to create a
Push A/B Test campaign object from my team's Composer UI. 
The goal of the following story that I worked on was to create the CRUD endpoints for such a functionality.
The techstack used to complete the work was Spring Framework, MongoDB and Kotlin in an already created RESTful API. 
More details and screenshots below. 


## Noteworthy Tasks

- First time creating a new suite of CRUD endpoints for current team using Kotlin, Spring framework, and 
mongo template. This includes creating proper controller, adapter, connector, service and model classes. 
- Utilize my team's establish system of creating application metrics and posting them to Grafana through TAP.
- Creating proper integration and unit tests following Test Drive Development (TDD) principles
## Learnings

- Developed my skills working with RESTful APIs by creating new CRUD endpoints
